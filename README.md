# parse-html-date-simd
AVX256 HTML Date Header parser. No branches. No loops. Fewer than 50 instructions. No validation.

Parses well-formed Date strings a la https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Date.
It will give you absolute garbage if the string is not well-formed exactly as described above.

Please don't actually use this as-is; it's really just a toy for me to learn AVX256 :)

Here's some pretty assembly to look at: https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/hbbThEes3
